            statistics show that only 20% of them will find a family. The others will continue to live with us and will
            be waiting for a lucky chance to become dearly loved.</p>
          <p class="subtitle about-content__subtitle">We feed our wards with the best food and make sure that they do
            not get sick, feel comfortable (including psychologically) and well. We are supported by 87 volunteers and
            28 employees of various skill levels. About 12% of the animals are taken by the shelter staff. Taking care
            of the animals, they become attached to the pets and would hardly ever leave them alone.</p>
